# Auto-Creative Engine for Ad Creatives

## 1. The Problem (Real World Scenario)
In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, businesses and agencies struggle to produce enough high-quality visual content to keep up with demand. Designing multiple variations of ad creatives for different platforms, tones, and audiences is a time-consuming and expensive process. Teams often spend weeks manually tweaking designs, writing copy, and coordinating between copywriters and designers, leading to bottlenecks and creative fatigue.

## 2. Expected End Result
The **Auto-Creative Engine** is a streamlined solution that automates the creative production process.
- **Input**: A user simply uploads a brand logo and a product image, and defines the desired brand tone and product details.
- **Process**: The system uses advanced AI to analyze the product, generate relevant marketing copy, and create stunning visual assets.
- **Output**: A downloadable ZIP file containing 10+ unique, high-resolution ad creative images along with a `metadata.json` file containing matching AI-generated captions, headlines, and call-to-actions.

## 3. Technical Approach
The system is built as a modern web application with a clear separation of concerns:
1.  **Frontend**: A user-friendly React interface allows users to upload assets and configure generation parameters (tone, number of variants).
2.  **Backend Orchestration**: A FastAPI backend handles the request, manages file uploads, and orchestrates the AI pipeline.
3.  **Multimodal Analysis**: We use **Google Gemini (Vision)** to "see" the uploaded product image. It analyzes the visual features, context, and aesthetics to generate detailed, scene-specific image prompts and matching ad copy.
4.  **Generative Art**: These prompts are fed into **Stable Diffusion XL (via Hugging Face)** to generate high-quality, photorealistic background scenes and ad visuals that feature the product concept.
5.  **Packaging**: The generated images and text metadata are packaged into a ZIP file for easy delivery.

## 4. Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
-   **AI & ML**:
    -   **Multimodal LLM**: Google Gemini (via `google-genai`)
    -   **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion XL (via `huggingface_hub`)
-   **Utilities**: Pydantic (Validation), Pillow (Image Processing), Python-Multipart

## 5. Challenges & Learnings
-   **Prompt Engineering**: Getting consistent and high-quality results from Stable Diffusion required careful tuning of the prompts generated by Gemini. We learned to instruct Gemini to focus on lighting, composition, and style to guide the image generator effectively.
-   **Multimodal Integration**: Passing image data seamlessly between the frontend, backend, and the Gemini API required robust file handling and understanding of the API's binary data requirements.
-   **Async Processing**: Generating multiple images is compute-intensive. We implemented asynchronous processing in FastAPI to ensure the server remains responsive while heavy AI tasks are running.

### Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
    HF_TOKEN=your_hf_token
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
